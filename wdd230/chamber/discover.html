          <h1>Demographic</h1>
          <p>
            Sweden has a population of over 102,000 people as of 2020, with more
            growth to come in future years. Gävle is as big as 1,613 km2 and is
            situated by the Baltic Sea. It has the same latitude as Helsinki and
            the same longtitude as Vienna and Cape Town. Summers can be really
            pleasant with 25 degrees celsius, while the winter can be bone
            biting cold, reaching temperatures as low as -30, and that does not
            include the winds coming in from the sea.
          </p>
          <p>
            With immediate access to the Baltic Ocean, Gävle has had a strategic
            place in both war and trade for several centuries. With an easily
            defended bay, it has repelled attackers back in time, but also
            provided a lot of jobs for the people. Everything from forests, sand
            beaches, pebble beaches, and big rock formations line Gävles coast.

          <h1>Events</h1>
          <p>
            Every year two of the biggest events are the celebration of the
            Gävle Goat and a city festvial held during the summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The celebration of the Gävle Goat go back decades, and is celebrated
            every year which is held during the first advent in December. Music,
            fireworks, singing, and a briefly told history of it is expected
            every year. Sadly, there is a different unofficial tradition tied to
            the goat. Unknown foul ruffians and villains from Gävles criminal
            underworld bet money on when the goat is going to burn down, and
            almost yearly it does. Some attempts have failed, but most of them
            succeed. Everything from running up to it with a lighter to shooting
            a flame arrow at it has been attempted. Despite everything being
            thrown at it, the Gävle goat is a sure sign that Christmas is near.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city festival occurs during the summer evenings for three days.
            A lot of businesses set up food stalls, carousels, games, prize
            stalls, and live music. Candy, such as the iconic rämmar can be
            bought, and Pokémon cards can be found for those who look to upgrade
            their decks.

          <h1>Attractions</h1>
          <p>
            Gävle has a lot to offer in terms of activities and attractions! The
            Länsmuseum gives a great insight into the past of Gävle during the
            1800s. Everything from fashion, to food, to how the home looked like
            and was decorated.
          </p>

            One of the most famous and biggest train museums in located in
            Gävle. You can try your hand on a life size train simulator, walk
            inside all manner of trains, both old and new, and get an insight of
            the lifes railroad workers lived as they toiled to build the
            railways in Sweden.
          </p>
          <p>
            The harbor in Gävle is a great scenic place with a lot of history.
            Although it no longer functions like it used to in its golden days,
            sitting on a pier and gazing out into the Baltic Sea, reminiscing of
            days gone by, is not so bad either.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concert house has hosted major events and famous musicians
            throughout the decades. The Yellowjackets with Bob Mintzer was a
            town favorite for all Jazz fans. Before being converted into a
            concert hall it was known as a Roman bathhouse up until the late
            1900s.
