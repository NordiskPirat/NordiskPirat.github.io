        <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>

          This website clearly showcase the visual hierarchy principle. It does
          so by placing the front person with the flame in higher contrast,
          lighting up his face. Directly behind there is a figure in gray,
          making a visual perspective to the sharp front. Going from front to
          back there are stops where your eyes go.

        <h1>Contrast</h1>
        <h2>Nintendo America</h2>
        <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo</a>
        <img src="/wdd230/lesson2/images/nintendo.jpg" alt="nintendo" />
        <p>
          The biggest contrast in this picture are the colors. Against the white
          background on the right side the rest of the colors pop out. The
          strong red and blue pull you in to them, while the green give variety.
          While the background is in chaos, the main title is white, making it a
          good contrast with each other, and it's easy to distinguish.

        <h1>Rule of Thirds</h1>
        <h2>Best Friends Sanctuary</h2>
        <a href="https://bestfriends.org/">Best Friends</a>

        <p>
          Specifically the tree and ground make up the rule of third in this
          picture. The human and dog is slightly more to the right, following
          again the rule. It is more pleasing to the eye because the subjects
          and objects are placed according to the rule of thirds, it leaves the
          other two thirds open.
